# Expense Tracker Mobile App

My first *React Native* project. Me and my partner often buy things for eachother but would still like to remain 
fair and pay back any expense.

Since I have **1.00$** transaction fee with my bank everytime I do a transfer, I figured this app will pay by itself by just 
marking the expenses and tracking the total instead of doing transfers each time.
